            <h1>Work Summary</h1>
            <p>I first worked in at a game store, Videogamecentral, where I mostly served as a secondary website data entrant and tested/inspected incoming used systems, accessories, and games. Later on, I also built a bit of register/storefront experience.<br> Afterward, I took several freelance jobs helping conceptualize apartment units, parade floats, and more. Early this decade, I served as a foot courier for Cornucopia Logistics in Manhattan, but have mostly done volunteer work at local food pantries and small tasks for senior citizen friends since.</p>

            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <p>I'm approachable and respectful, listen to others, and try to fortify my understanding with thorough notes and questions. I try to treat the unrest of others with respect and patience.<br>  
                I'm also creative and experienced in many art forms, including drawing, music composition, writing, and photography. Through building K'nex models and dismantling toys and devices for fun, Iâ€™ve become meticulous and observant. I'm SCUBA certified, and my engagement in diving and general love of the natural world and machines require me to be cautious, studious, and prepared.</p>
