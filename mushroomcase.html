    <div class="panel"><p class="sbjctmatter">Our instructors from Change Food For Good taught us some rudiments of raising fungi, and supplied 
      kits which will yield a few harvests of edible Lion's Mane fungi if tended properly. With their guidance and 
      the utilities at Collective Focus, we readied these kits and took them home.</p></div>

      <div class="panel">
        <p class="sbjctmatter">Though our class supplied us for this go, I'd like to know 
        how much materials to repeat it would cost. A shallow search suggests that kits may 
        be available for $28-32 (prior to shipping and tax.) I still want to compare the total 
        price of individual trustworthy components (bags, substrate, pellets, and mushroom spawn.) 
        Our hydroponic farm system project taught us that purchasing components alone can sometimes 
        be more economical despite the greater preparation time.
        <br>
        <br>
        At Collective Focus, we abided by procedure to fill our filter bags with substrate, pellets, 
        and grain spawn, then pasteurized and inoculated them to grow at home.

       The fungi colonized their container quite thoroughly by day 19, but I waited until day 
       21 to cut it open in case it wanted to spread even further. The sporocarp(s) has been apparent 
       and growing steadily since day 24.
       <br>
       Since cutting the bag open, I relocated it to a tall box to keep sunlight out. I've also started to mist it with water from a spray bottle daily. But I ponder:
       <br>
       <br>
       >Is there an optimal time of day to mist it?
       <br>
       >>How many times should it be done daily?

    While the materials were already gathered for us, we didn't have enough time at Collective Focus to 
pasteurize the mixture as well as we would have liked.

At home, the initial challenge was safe storage because of limited space, but the culture 
    fit neatly atop a tall shelf in a curtained closet.

      track its growth.

      <div class="panel">
        <p class="sbjctmatter">This project has yet to end, and so cannot yet be decisively concluded. However, I will amass a list 
          of ideas and considerations that may improve this process or lead to future experiments.
          
          <h5>Improving My Procedure/Curiosity and Consideration</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>I should have placed a tag on the top of the filter bag (not obstructing the filter,) upon which I'd tally each day 
              the fungus has been developing.      
            </li>
            <li>In future efforts, I may cover the box I set the filter bag in with a small section of screen, curtain, or net. It 
              would make monitoring the colony slightly more laborious, but also keep curious arthropods out.
            </li>
            <li>I'd experiment with different numbers, sizes, and locations of bag cuts, since they influence how the fruiting 
              bodies leave the bag. Perhaps I'd roll the bag on its bag, cut the wide face that it now turned upward, and widen that 
              cut every other day. 
              <!-- Insert a photo or drawing of the above with arrows to demonstrate! -->
            </li>
            <li>Next, I'd like to try raising one of the two other species we were offered.

        <p class="sbjctmatter">There is not one yet, but I would like to add fungus and insect APIs to the website--I so often photograph 
          them outdoors, yet don't always have means to identify them. If and once that happens, it may be an extension 
          of the existing plant identifier page, and the process will be detailed here.
