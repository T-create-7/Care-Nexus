        <p class="sbjctmatter">Though our class supplied us for this go, I'd like to know 
        how much materials to repeat it would cost. A shallow search suggests that kits may 
        be available for $28-32 (prior to shipping and tax.) I still want to compare the total 
        price of individual trustworthy components (bags, substrate, pellets, and mushroom spawn.) 
        Our hydroponic farm system project taught us that purchasing components alone can sometimes 
        be more economical despite the greater preparation time.
        <br>
        <br>
        At Collective Focus, we abided by procedure to fill our filter bags with substrate, pellets, 
        and grain spawn, then pasteurized and inoculated them to grow at home.

       The fungi colonized their container quite thoroughly by day 19, but I waited until day 
       21 to cut it open in case it wanted to spread even further. The sporocarp(s) has been apparent 
       and growing steadily since day 24.
       <br>
       Since cutting the bag open, I relocated it to a tall box to keep sunlight out. I've also started to mist it with water from a spray bottle daily. But I ponder:
       <br>
       <br>

    While the materials were already gathered for us, we didn't have enough time at Collective Focus to 
    pasteurize the mixture as well as we would have liked.
    <br>
    <br>     
    At home, the initial challenge was safe storage because of limited space, but the culture 
    fit neatly atop a tall shelf in a curtained closet.
    <br>
    <br>
    I had to relocate to another building just as the Lion's Mane was fruiting, but 
    I was still able to take it with me and water it. I also harvested it a few days later than I would have liked, 
    and fear that may hinder its next flushes of growth.

      phase!

      I also considering measuring the mushrooms as they grew, but decided against it. In a calmer situation,

          The results were uniquely delicious. Some sites and studies I've seen report that Lion's Mane contains various vitamins and 
          nutrients that can support brain and immune health. It can be consumed cooked or raw, or even powdered or used in smoothies. 
          I found it chewy and a bit dry, so I opted to use it in stir fry meals or soups. I'd certainly welcome more meals with it.

          But it remains to see if additional flushes will develop, and the marks left behind where I removed the first harvest concern

          <h5>Improving My Procedure/Curiosity; additional Considerations</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>I should have placed a tag on the top of the filter bag (not obstructing the filter,) upon which I'd tally each day 
              the fungus has been developing. I could also have marked the side of the box I placed it all in.      
            </li>
            <li>In future efforts, I may cover the box I set the filter bag in with a small section of screen, curtain, or net. It 
              would make monitoring the colony slightly more laborious, but also keep curious arthropods out.
            </li>
            <li>I'd experiment with different numbers, sizes, and locations of bag cuts, since they influence how the fruiting 
              bodies leave the bag. Perhaps I'd roll the bag on its back, cut the wide face that it now turned upward, and widen that 
              cut every other day.

            </li>
          </ul>
          Next, I'd like to try raising one of the two other species we were offered, but I'd also welcome raising more Lion's Mane with 
          revised technique.

          them outdoors, yet don't always have means to identify them. It could also give a preliminary diagnosis of any plant/fungus health 
          issues. If and once I add them, they may be an extension of the existing plant identifier page, and the process will be detailed here.
