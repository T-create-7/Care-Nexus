            <h1>Tykwon's Doings</h1>
            <p>Greetings! Here is Tykwon Gavins, a variform artist of many interests. I’m reserved, but caring, patient, and studious. 
              I’m constantly seeking new crafts to learn, especially ones that give me more chances to wander the natural world or 
              ways to create. At present, I especially want to learn 3D printing and pertinent CAD/modeling methods.
              <br>I'm also an avid diver. I'm gradually gaining further skills and knowledge and eventually hope to find ways to admix 
              and apply them.

            <h1>Work Summary</h1>
            <p>
              I first worked in at a game store, Videogamecentral, where I mostly served as a secondary website data entrant and 
              tested/inspected incoming used systems, accessories, and games. Later on, I also built a bit of register/storefront 
              experience.

              <br> Afterward, I took several freelance jobs helping conceptualize apartment units, parade floats, and more. Early 
              this decade (the 2020s), I served as a foot courier for Cornucopia Logistics in Manhattan, but have mostly done 
              volunteer work at local food pantries and small tasks for senior citizen friends since.

        <!-- Skills section -->
        <section id="Abilities" class="col2">
            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <p>I'm approachable and respectful, listen to others, and try to fortify my understanding with thorough notes and questions. 
              I try to treat the unrest of others with concern.
              <br>Through Change Food For Good’s generous Intro to Agtech course, I’ve been initiated in the ways of CSS, HTML, Javascript, 
              and Github. I’ve also earned some introductory knowledge of hydroponics systems and the challenges of their 
              development, assembly, and maintenance.
            </p>  
            <p>I'm creative and experienced in some art forms, including drawing, music composition, writing, and photography. Through 
              building K'nex models and dismantling toys and devices for fun, I’ve become meticulous and observant. I'm SCUBA certified 
              (just since 2023,) and my engagement in diving and general love of the natural world and machines require me to be cautious, 
              curious, and prepared.
              <br>
              <br>
              My camera, sketch pad, and portable voice recorder go with me whenever safe and feasible.
            </p>
            <p>I've been snorkeling and freediving in various parts of New York's Jamaica Bay since about 2010. Lately, I've been developing 
              dive specialties like tank refilling/inspection and Computer Nitrox diving towards an eventual advanced certification and 
              the opportunities it may yield.
              <br> 
              I also have nascent ideas for a few small developments in the field, 
              but I need a far greater understanding of pumps and compressors as they apply to diving to approach and validate them. 
              <br>I don't own my own SCUBA unit.
              <!-- &mdash; among other reasons, I'd have nowhere to store it, nor means or funds to frequently 
              transport or refill it  -->
              However, I gain a wealth of helpful experience during my Summer water outings, where I remove any fishing litter 
              I can find (hooks, sinkers, lines, etc.) and sometimes help fishermen recover their snagged tools. It also affords me ample 
              chance to familiarize myself my underwater camera, cutting tool, dive computer, and anything else I've been fortunate to gain.
              <br>
              <br>
              As of 2024, I've begun to write reviews of some equipment I own. You can find some of them
