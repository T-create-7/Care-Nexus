          This project owes its existence simply to nature, my own curiosity, and opportunity. 
          <br>
          <br>
          While en route to a class trip in October of 2024, I spied a low-hanging wasp nest and photographed it. Later on, I 
          recalled the handful of them I happened upon in 2022 and 2023. Since I was gifted a superb camera and so often 
          travel with it, I decided to log any other wasp nests that I could find.
          <br>
          <br>
          Over the months, I came to realize that this was great timing for such a survey. In these seasons, the wasps are 
          dormant or in hiding, and the nests are much easier to see with many trees bereft of foliage.

              <h5>
                <span class="underln">What are Wasps?</span>
              </h5>
              <p class="sbjctmatter">
                As you may know, wasps are winged insects within the Order <span class="term">Hymenoptera</span>, a classification they 
                share with bees, ants, sawflies, and a few other relatives. However, wasps are NOT bees. They do seem to be 
                ancestors from which many bees developed, however.
                <br>
                <br>
                Many know or revile wasps for their potent bites, venomous stings, or other natural armaments and defenses. 
                Said stingers are actually modified ovipositors (egg-laying structures,) so males lack them. But some male 
                wasps may have less-threatening defensive spines instead.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are several subfamilies of wasps, with different social and nesting habits. While many of us know bees 
                for their great work as pollinators, wasps do as well, though to a lesser degree. Wasps lack the hairs and 
                pollen-collecting leg "baskets" of bees. However, some wasps who pollinate plants specialize, and give their 
                best aid to select plant species.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some wasps hunt and capture other arthropods to feed to their offspring or set eggs within. In this way, they 
                can be formidable pest countermeasures for agriculturalists, if introduced carefully. This means of employing 
                other creatures to help minimize damage to crops is called

                <!-- TASK: Place image of my devices and gift here -->
                Beyond the computer and software used to code this page, I needed my camera, binoculars, and any sort of 
                notepad. The camera (with zoom lens) and binoculars are both great for combing trees and buildings for nests. 
                A cell phone camera may be suitable, too, but you might need to zoom more powerfully than some phones can 
                while retaining a clear image.
                <br>
                <br>
                To compile info for this map, I collected at least four images for each nest found: 
                <br>
                  <ul>
                <li>One broad view of the location to help a curious viewer find 
                it, preferably with the nest in-view.
                </li>
                <li>One close-up of a nearby street sign or numbered building where possible.
                </li>
                <li>At least two close-ups of the nest from different angles.
                </li>  
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <span class="underln">Identifying Nests</span>
              </h5>
              <p class="sbjctmatter">
                Wasps are diligent builders, although not all chew and collect wood fibers to build the classic paper nests 
                that you'll find catalogued in my map below. Some instead make smaller cells of mud. Some species may nest 
                underground, within pipes, under the eaves of roofs, and in other places that may bring them close to humans.
                <br>
                <br>
                During my first job in a video game store, even I once found wasp nest cells inside of a used Nintendo 
                cartridge (which still worked once cleaned!)
                <br>
                <br>
                I don't disturb wasp nests, but this project has given me a welcome chance to observe them over a frame of 
                several months. Most that I've found have become well-worn, with no one actively repairing them, and a few 
                have fallen and been erased completely by weather. But so many of them endure despite the snow, wind, and 
                rain, and remain recognizeable. This gradual collapse has treated me to some interesting interior views.
                <br>
                <br> 
                Daylight is also an important resource, since other creatures' nests and leavings (including humans, of 
                course!) can look similar in the shade. I don't mark an insect on my map until I've affirmed that it is one.

                The greatest challenge of this project by far has been learning to code an interactive map. I've found over six dozen nests, and have multiple 
                pictures of each, so I also needed to learn ways to make that load less taxing on a viewer's device. I considered using html map elements to 
                create one, but with hundreds of images to apply for the nests, that could be impractical.
                <!-- Include a link to the article -->
                <br>
                <br>
                A lesser yet tall impediment was the loss of my camera, which suffered terminal moisture damage when I took outside during light snow 
                early in December. That rendered me unable to take fine quality photos for a month.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also want this project to feature original artwork of my own creation, which is difficult since I hardly consider any of my creative 
                works complete or worth sharing. I forayed into the use of Piskel, a free, browser-based pixel art application, to create the icons 
                for my map.
                <br>
                Similarly, I learned use of MuseScore4, to give myself of means applying music I created to this page. My original way of composing music is more 
                convenient, but doesn't let me share files as easily.
                <br>
                <br>
                The survey and photography was simple and fun, but as anything, can be improved. For example, if I wanted to make this info more exhaustive, 
                I could give each nest a designation and update its info box with a new picture every time I see it. That would allow onlookers to see its 
                deterioration (or repair!) progressively.
                I could also use my voice recorder to take such notes efficiently.

                      Nature has likely worn this nest to shambles. 
                      It still hangs, but as just a few exposed cells. 
                      Alternately, it may have belonged to a small group 
                      that had to abandon it prematurely. Some wasp 
                      species normally build small, open nests like this,

                  Fallen nests have dropped from their hold. These tend to crumble out after a few days of weathering, so you mightn't be able to find them.
                  I created these nest sprites in Piskel, a browser-based pixel art application. I had to consider not only how well they may convey their intent, 
                  but how well they contrast whichever map or mapping service I use, and what size is ideal.  -->

                  <p class="sbjctmatter">
                    I live on the edge of East New York, and regularly transit several bordering areas throughout my common doings. I visited Fulton Park twice, and 
                  was excited to find several wasp homes there. If I continue or renew this project, I'll be sure to roam a few new areas that I can comfortably 
                  access.
                  
                  Between late October and the date I submitted this page, I found over 80 hymenopterid nests. The greatest counts of nests a single block (10 and 8, 
                  respectively) were on a large block with ample grass, and the block of a community farm I live near. The block of a community farm near me has the most 
                  I've yet seen on a single city block, 8. Unsurprisingly, they seem to be most concentrated around large parks and gardens. Even a simple action like perusing 
                  the opposite site of a street often reveals more hanging nests. There looks to be some variety in nest construction, likely the consequence of different species 
                  or available materials. The insects chew and form this paper themselves. Perhaps especially versed or knowledgeable observers could surmise which types or parts of plants they use by nest 
                  color.

                  For every nest I found, there are undoubtedly many that I did not or cannot, and many possibly lost to conditions before my search.

                      <li>Over my last few weeks of searching, a few nests may have been removed. My searches occasionally drew attention to the nest as passersby wondered what I was even looking

                        I've known subways and modern buildings to employ bird-deterrent spikes to try to discourage habitation. While I've seen various attempts at wasp discouragement, 
                  like artificial nests, I don't know how well any work. As the climate shifts, these insects may become increasingly close and widespread neighbors.

                  Though some wasp varieties feast upon bees, others can be strong garden security. Indeed, my learnings in Intro to AgTech presented some wasps among the best integrated 
                  pest management (IPM) guests.

                    It was a joy to exercise my observation, curiosity, and photo skills, and watching the nests endure or change over time was insightful. I'll be able to 
                    document or organize any similar future endeavors better, too. I earned a variety of responses from onlookers, from puzzled gazes to curious inquiry.

                        Having done this, I'm excited to try to incorporate Kindwise's insect identifier into this site next. 
                        I'd like to learn if it can hypothesize wasp species by nests. I relayed a few messages with some 
                        company staff, and learned that the identifier was trained with some images of wasps on nests. Still, 
                        it isn't expected to be able to gauge species by such a sight alone.
