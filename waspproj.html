          <br>
          <br>
          While en route to a class trip around November of 2024, I spied a low-hanging wasp nest and photographed it. Later on, I 
          recalled the handful of them I happened upon in 2022 and 2023. Since I was gifted a superb camera and so often 
          travel with it, I decided to log any other wasp nests that I could find during the colder seasons.
          <br>
          <br>
          Over the months, I came to realize that this was great timing for such a survey. In Fall and Winter, the wasps are 
          dormant or in hiding, and the nests are much easier to find with many trees bereft of foliage.
          <br>
          <br>
          I live near an edge of Brooklyn, on a veritable boundary between it and Queens, so it's easy to reach a variety of 
          neighborhoods within but a 45-minute walk.

                <br>
                Many people know or revile wasps for their potent bites, venomous stings, or other natural armaments and 
                defenses. Wasps, unlike most bees, are also capable of stinging repeatedly without dying, and some humans are 
                allergic to their venoms. Said stingers are actually modified 
                <span class="term"
                      title="This is the organ through which some animals, especially arthropods, set their eggs.">
                        ovipositors</span>, so males lack them. But some male wasps may have 
                        less-threatening defensive spines instead.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are several subfamilies of wasps, with different social and nesting habits. While humans commonly acknowledge 
                bees for their great work as pollinators, wasps can as well, though to a lesser degree. Outwardly and 
                behaviorally, wasps are less adapted for the kind of pollination bees can perorm superbly. Wasps have fewer 
                hairs than do bees, and lack their pollen-collecting leg "baskets". However, some wasps who pollinate plants 
                specialize, and give their best aid to select plant species. Certain sorts even spend part of their life cycle 
                within fruits.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some wasps hunt and capture other arthropods to feed to their offspring or set eggs within. In this way, they 
                can be formidable pest countermeasures for agriculturalists if introduced carefully. This means of employing 
                other creatures to help minimize damage to crops, the environment, and human consumers is a part of

                Beyond the computer, data storage, and software used to code this page, I needed my camera, binoculars, and 
                any sort of notepad. The camera (with zoom lens) and binoculars are both great for combing trees and 
                buildings for nests. A cell phone camera may be suitable, too, but you might need to zoom more powerfully 
                than some phones can and use manual controls to retain a clear image.

                that you'll find catalogued in my map below. Some instead nest in smaller pot or cannon-shaped cells of mud. 
                Some species may nest underground, within pipes, under the eaves of roofs, and in other places that may 
                bring them close to humans.  
                <br>
                <br>
                During my first job in a video game store, I even once found wasp nest cells inside of a used Nintendo 
                Entertainment System cartridge (which still worked once cleaned!) I wish I had photos of it.
                <br>
                <br>
                Come the cold seasons, these nests are abandoned. Mated queens, bearing their next generation of eggs, seclude themselves 
                in dormancy. They are often the only survivors. Although wasps remember attractive locations, they don't tend to risk 
                reusing a nest if it endures.
                <br>
                <br>
                Wasps even perform great home upkeep, not only mending damage, but at times manually heating, aerating, or 
                removing moisture from their homes.
                <br>
                <br>
                I don't disturb wasp nests, but this project has given me a welcome chance to observe them over a frame of 
                several months. Most that I've found have become well-worn, with no one actively repairing them, and a few 
                have fallen and been erased completely by weather. But so many of them endure despite the snow, wind, and 
                rain, and remain recognizeable. This gradual collapse has treated me to some interesting interior views.
                <br>
                <br> 
                Daylight is an important resource, since other creatures' nests and leavings (including those of humans!) 
                can look similar in the shade or from a distance. Squirrel/bird nests, branch-bound balloons, plastic bags, and 
                even pants have all been distractors. I don't mark an insect nest on my map until I've affirmed that it is one.

                  My ways of seeking and logging these nests have become more thorough over the months, 
                  and may yet improve in similar future efforts. The main aspects of this info collection are
                  <br> 
                  Pathing (determining the routes you scout); 
                  <br>
                  Searching (how you look for these nests); 
                  <br>
                  Logging (how you record your findings.)
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The point of proceduralizing this isn't rigidity, but repeatability and data retention! 
                  The more reliable your methods, the more you'll chances you'll have for engaging observation. 
                  I don't discourage searching or wandering on a whim--it is fun and ofttimes rewarding.
                  With some of the tools mentioned above (or your alternatives,) enough memory for <em>at least</em> 
                  100 photos, and knowledge of the day's forecast, I'd do the following on any outing for this project:

                        <ul>
                          <li>If you intend to search a large and especially unfamiliar area, try to have a visual copy of it that you can edit. 
                            Any means will do; a physical print, digital, or another of your making.</li>
                          <li>Mark your route as you travel. Intersections are fine reference points.</li>
                          <li>If you're on a round trip, trek down a different side of the street or a different street entirely on the return 
                            to broaden your search.</li>
                          <li>Veer down side streets if you have the time and desire.</li>

                      <strong>Searching</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Look for paper nests not only in trees, but on the ground, under building overhangs, and on other structures.</li>
                          <li>Look for signs that a nest may have fallen apart or been removed, such as cells or paper wall scraps on the ground, 
                            or rings where one was once attached to another structure.</li>
                          <li>Use viewing aids like binoculars to browse branches and surfaces carefully. Nests that have fallen apart or were abandoned early can be very 
                            small.</li>
                          <li>Verify that an object is/was a hymenopterid nest before you definitely mark it as one.</li> 
                          <li>If you can't tell because of limited lighting or other obstructions, return at another time of day or get a clearer view of it until you're 
                            sure!</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li class="aspect">
                      <strong>Logging</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>When you find a nest, record its location. You can even do this photographically in a broad shot. You can include a generalization of 
                            its distance from the ground, too. Consider any info that can help someone find it.</li>
                          <li>Consider snapping landmarks or other reminders like street signs or addressed buildings.</li>
                          <li>Don't ignore relative size, shape, color, or proximity to other nests. You may eventually be able to draw inferences from them.</li>
                          <li>Collect several zoomed shots of a nest, and from different angles. What seems pristine from one viewpoint may not be from below or behind.</li>
                          <li>You can even use hand signals in your photos to help differentiate entries.</li>
                          <li>Periodically revisit listed nests to check on them. Note changes or occurences, especially major ones. If you'd like to create a time lapse 
                            progression of a specific nest, photograph it from the same position.</li>
                          <li>Add any nests found to a map at your earliest convenience. This can even be as simple as filling in a spreadsheetor adding notes to a screenshot 
                            of a Google Map. The latter was my method before I learned of other options, and may still be valuable as backup.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul> 
                  
                  <p class="sbjctmatter">
                    If you use a mapping service, try to choose one that befits the scale of your project and the level of 
                    coding ability you're at or want to achieve. I chose ScribbleMaps since it allows custom map markers and map imbedding 
                    even with a free account. Had I also taken advantage of Scribble's spreadsheet support, it would have been much easier to track 
                    and update my entries. I initially wanted to submit this project once I found 35 nests, but am now beyond twice that. 
                    Please consider using a spreadsheet if you expect your map to have over 20 entries, especially if they can change.

                    Though this project <em>requires</em> no funds, enough money to pay for Scribblemaps' subscription would absolutely improve it. Only then 
                    would I have the data storage to give every listing at least one image.

                The greatest challenge of this project by far has been learning to incorporate an interactive map. I've found over seven 
                dozen nests, and have multiple pictures of each, so I also needed to consider ways to make that load less taxing on 
                a viewer's device. I considered using html map elements to create a map, but with so many areas to define, and hundreds 
                of images to apply for the nests, it could be impractical.
                <br>
                <br>
                A lesser yet tall impediment was the loss of my camera, which suffered terminal moisture damage when I took it outside 
                briefly during light snow early in December. That rendered me unable to take fine quality photos for a month.
                <br>
                <br>
                Back in November, I didn't think the project would reach this total or scale. My older photos for this plan weren't labeled or 
                documented as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also want this project to feature original artwork of my own creation, which is difficult since I seldom finish any of my art. 
                I forayed into the use of 
                <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/"
                   target="_blank"
                   rel="noopener noreferrer"
                   title="This is a simple and free way to create, animate, and download pixel art."

                the icons for my map.
                <br>
                Similarly, I learned use of 
                <a href="https://musescore.org/en"
                   target="_blank"
                   rel="noopener noreferrer"
                   title="This is a free music composition app which allows you to convert parts of your pieces into sound files or share the score itself. 
                   The basic features are logical, though they may be slightly unintuitive at start."
                   alt="The MuseScore 4 application">MuseScore 4</a>, to give myself of means applying music I created to this page. My original 
                   way of composing music is much more convenient and still my preference, but doesn't let me share files as easily or 
                   completely.
                <br>
                <br>
                The survey and photography were simple and fun, but as anything, can be improved. For example, if I wanted to make this info more 
                exhaustive, I could give each nest a designation and update its info box with a new picture every time I see it. That would allow 
                onlookers to see its deterioration (or repair!) progressively.
                I could also use my voice recorder to take such notes efficiently. Handling a notepad and repeatedly swapping camera lenses 
                is at times inconvenient.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, taking pictures of wasp nests on a home can make the human tenants suspicious. Thankfully, many are but curious, understanding, 
                and ultimately supportive. But I've come to always have this page or my map open on my cell phone to help explain myself. Perhaps a 
                customized shirt, hat, or wearable sign could help ease others.

                          This nest may have some peeling or torn walls, but 
                          remains whole overall. Interior cells may be exposed.

                          Nature has likely worn this nest to shambles. 
                          It still hangs, but as just a few exposed cells. 
                          Alternately, it may have belonged to a small group 
                          that had to abandon it prematurely. Some wasp 
                          species normally build small, open nests like this, 
                          so there's also a chance it was always this way.

                      My custom markers are yet incomplete, so I have to use Scribble's for now. Reddish markers indicate nests found on or after May 1, 2025. 
                      Green markers represent those added between February 21, 2025 to April 30, 2025. Blue markers are the oldest--those 
                      found between November, 2024 and late February, 2025. A marker that's tipped over horizontally denotes a fallen nest.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can click on a marker to see more details about its nest, though I still have to fill a few in. Any highlighted perimeter has a 
                    summary you can access the same way. Again, a free ScribbleMaps account doesn't offer enough memory for me to post a photos of every 
                    location. You can use the settings in the lower-left corner to allow markers to cluster, then zoom out to see my present total.

                    I live on the edge of East New York, and regularly transit several bordering areas throughout my common doings. I visited Fulton Park twice, 
                    and was excited to find several wasp homes there. If I continue or renew this project, I'll be sure to roam a few new areas that I can 
                    comfortably access.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Between late October and the date I wanted to submit this page, I found over 80 hymenopterid nests. The greatest counts of nests on single block back then 
                  (10 and 8, respectively) were on a large block with ample grass, and the block of a community farm I live near. Unsurprisingly, they seem to be most 
                  concentrated around large parks and gardens. There looks to be some variety in nest construction, likely the consequence of different species 
                  or available materials. Perhaps especially versed or knowledgeable observers could surmise which materials they used by nest color.
                  <br>
                  <br> 
                  For every nest I found, there are undoubtedly many that I did not or cannot, and many possibly lost to conditions before my search.

                      <li>Over my last few weeks of searching in February, a few mapped nests may have been removed. Might my searches have been responsible? They occasionally drew attention to nests as passersby realized what I was actually looking

                        I've known subways and modern buildings to employ bird-deterrent spikes to try to discourage their habitation. While I've seen or read of various attempts 
                        at wasp misdirection, like artificial nests or painting walls to look like the sky, I don't know how well any work. As the climate shifts, these insects 
                        may become increasingly prominent neighbors to humans. Perhaps that can be mindfully coordinated to help protect attractive crops that they and other beings 
                        mutually enjoy.
                        <br>
                        As with many living things, there still exist techniques or traits of wasps that humans can productively emulate. The kinematics of insect flight readily 
                        inspire miniature flying machines, and their nest architecture could yield space-efficient storage or housing features.
                        <br>
                        Other possible muses include their ways of communicating and navigating (though perhaps not as well-reported or sophisticated as those of bees); their 
                        ways of processing and waterproofing material; and the stinger's similar function to syringes.

                    On 3/29/25, I tried to contact the inhabitants of 54 Euclid Ave when I found a nest. No one answered, but a neighbor who was sweeping the sidewalk did. He 
                    offered to tell them, and also took interest in my project, wondering if it was my profession. He hadn't noticed the nest before our meeting, and asserted 
                    that he's originally from Arizona, where he never saw some of the insect species common here in NY.

                    A woman living at 137-33 79th Street had known of the nest(s) above her window for years. The insects have never caused trouble, so she doesn't mind it, and 
                    respectfully acknowledges that they must have chosen that spot for a reason. Most of these nests see use for just one active year, so I wonder if it's still in 
                    use, and by what.

                      Wasps look to have a well-established population in this state, and will likely continue to. 
                      But what variety of species do we share these neighborhoods with, and how have their numbers 
                      been changing? I hope that ours aren't a grievous hazard to other pollinators, but 
                      their presence could well harmonize with indoor or hydroponics farmers looking for some crop 
                      protectors. This is, of course, a huge generalization. Their diets and the long-term 
                      effects of their presence and "employment" mightn't be so predictable. I hope this project will 
                      draw some interest in wasps and their potential effects on the region without purely inciting 
                      an aversion to them. I'd love for this effort to prove useful for some nearby ecologists or 
                      other scientists/enthusiasts. Perhaps there's some correlation between wasp density and the 
                      introduction or spread of other local lifeforms or factors. Human homes are clearly secure 
                      structures for these hymenopterids, and they can make use of building surfaces in ways humans

                      <br>
                      During one of my class trips in Change-Food-For-Good's <em>Intro to AgTech</em> course, I briefly 
                      glimpsed a captivating structure in the distance. A guide told me that it's the Pollinators' Pavillion, 
                      a structure made to foster and observe various solitary bee species, though it wasn't presently in service. 
                      Could agriculturalists use similar, smaller-scale sctructures to peaceably invite wasps?

                              <dd>An approachable book on bees, with some wasp info peppered throughout. It’s humorously subjective, but at least as passionate and pleasantly-illustrated. It takes a more casual approach to presenting info, but dispenses some nice, modern facts.

                              <dd>A fine introductory book of pixel art. It’s largely focused on character sprites, but gives some fine info on shading and more as well.

                              <dd>This is a rather focused book that guides one on many tenets of site design. It teems with examples seen on various modern sites, and discusses 
                              navigability, grid/column layouts, and the worth of giving one's site a recognizeable visual style or theme.

                              <dd>Though no longer recent, this is a thorough book on these three fundaments of webpage design, with a lot of good practices for user-focused site design.

                        Having done this, I'm excited to try to incorporate Kindwise's insect and mushroom identifiers into this site next. 
                        I'd like to learn if it can hypothesize wasp species by nests. I relayed a few messages with some 
                        company staff, and learned that the identifier was trained with some images of wasps on nests. Still, 
                        it isn't expected to be able to gauge species by such a sight 
                        <em>alone</em>.

                        I may also present this to any curious botanists or ecologists, who may be able to descry some correlation 
                        between the types of plants in an area and its wasp population.

                        I'm likely to repeat this project next year, from a fresh count, and hopefully with better methods, coding, camera skill, 
                        and accessories.
