      <p class="sbjctmatter">This report expounds upon my ideation of Pink Prospects, a small-scale hydroponic drip system that I may develop within 
        a community space, Pink Houses Community Farm. Pink Prospects is intended to improve public awareness of hydroponics while also offering useful 
        culturally-desired crops that mightn’t be readily available.
        <br>

    <p class="sbjctmatter">Though Pink Prospects will be the focus of this document, it will also briefly present some of my other small-scale food system

        <br>
      My neighborhood--East New York, Brooklyn has been reported as one of the poorest in the area, and is also a food desert with a high density of fast 
      food chains. Yet paradoxically, there are several well-kept growing spaces within ten blocks of me, and a good number of weekly food distributions.

    <button class="accordion"><h1>2. Project Overview</h1></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="sbjctmatter">
          <h5><span class="underln">Origin</span></h5>
          My project took form as the teachings of Change Food for Good’s Intro to AgTech course and my own observations admixed. I’ve regularly volunteered at 
          several food pantries weekly over recent years, and love visiting Grow NYC’s Cypress Hills farmstand as well. Access to food resources has improved 
          here, but still seems disjointed. There are many great public farms and families with prolific, passionately-kept gardens. Yet many people who need 
          these services seem unaware of their existence.
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="sbjctmatter">Additionally, some local composting services in our neighborhood have been defunded and terminated because of low or improper use. 
          I shared compost with the Cypress Hills GROWNYC Farmstand for most of the past two years, and formed great friendships with its attendants. Yet there 
          were increasingly many weeks when I was the only person to drop off scraps, even though the service was available all year. Our course tasked us with 
          trying to find a hydroponic solution to a food system issue. Some of the various public growing spaces in the neighborhood may be able to foray into 
          hydroponics to help draw interest in both their activities and the practice itself. That could ultimately strengthen the community, food education, and 
          give these organizations and services opportunities to cross promote.

        <!-- List of considered factors -->
        <p class="sbjctmatter">
          <h5><span class="underln">Considered Factors</span></h5>
          A local, outdoor hydroponics system should be tuned to at least the following points:
          <ul> 
          <li>Location and available space</li> 
            Systems indoors at home are generally safe and the easiest to access, but need artificial lighting.
            <br>Outdoor systems may ask for more of your time and diligence for troubleshooting and maintenance.
            <br>A community space still needs clearance for its own personnel and activity.
          <li>Environmental factors</li>
            Are the conditions right for the welfare of personnel, crop, and the system itself?
            <br>Does amaranth befit the climate and weather? Heavy wind can be an issue for tall crops.
            <br>My system may resort to solar power, which will need me to orient a panel properly for the best effect.
          <li>Legal permission</li>
            Would I even be allowed to establish this system? 
            <br>Some public locations may have regulation against it, or require permits and such.
          <li>Sustainability</li> 
            These are the fundaments of how well and soundly my system and service may perform in the long term. 
            <br>Even factors like the time your plants take to mature can contribute.
            <br>Encouraging others to try it for themselves is also valuable.
            <br>For your operation to persist (especially if it expands,) you may need helpers, and you'll need to inform them thoroughly!
          <li>Benefits/ Appeal</li>
            These can resemble elements of sustainability, but are also nuanced. 
            <br>I could have offer an edible crop, yet potentially lose favor if no guests want it.
            <br>Thankfully, many of the people who asked about my project in this neighborhood love callaloo
          <li>Documentation of procedures, safety, and plant health</li>
            Logging procedures well is a fine way to initiate others to hydroponics. 
            <br>Instructions should be thorough, but simple, and introduce a reader to necessary terms. 
            <br>If you don't monitor plant health, you'll be worse at tracing problems or repeating successes.
            <br>As a system that develops edible plants, cleanliness is especially important in ALL plant operations and system maintenance
          <li>Period of operation</li>
          Operating seasonally limits volume of produce, yet growing year round requires more resources, development, and possibly personnel. 
          <br>You may need to relocate the system or become familiar with additional crops to function continuously.
          <br>It could be prudent to scale the size and timing of your operation to the amount of time you're willing to allot.
          <li>Plant casualties</li>
          Even great farms and farmers account for a margin of loss. Not all seeds succeed.
          <ul>
        </p>
        <p class="sbjctmatter">
          <h5><span class="underln">My recommendations and reasoning</span></h5>
           I planned this system at its initial scale in respect to my inexperience and its power source. That extends to its seasonality. This 
           is equal parts a test of myself, the plants + hydroponics, and public interest. 
          <br>
          To increase the worth of the project, I'd want it to inform the community, not just through exposure to hydroponics, but perhaps 
          a map that details where and when the various food pantries in our neighborhood distribute. 
           With experience, it may be possible to accelerate yield not only by expanding the system, but by growing from cuttings! I may be 
           able to focus some of the off season on seed storage or starting instead. 
          <br>
          Our class site visits were all highly informative, but so was consulting locals. My gardening neighbors, the Dixons, raise many plants, 
          including some types of amaranth. They taught me of its health benefits, repeat harvesting, and how easily it can spread.

        <p class="sbjctmatter">
          There are several components to the problems I want to address. There seems to be a general lack of public info on the composting process, 
          assuring that only homes with gardeners may easily learn of it. That lack of attention and misuse of the service easily gets it demonetized. 
          It's especially disappointing since we have so many nice local farms.

        <li>The lack of electrical power at Pink Houses Community Farm eventually lead me to learn 
          of alternatives! There are relatively inexpensive solar-powered drip irrigation pumps 
          <!-- (like these (link link))  -->
          that should be great for a small system like this. Later, I was told of another alternative

        <li>My first choice of crop wasn’t suitable for hydroponics of my inexperience, but I 
          learned that callaloo is perhaps an ideal starter crop. To list a few benefits, it is apparently 
          easy to grow hydroponically, drought tolerant, and accepts a wide range of growing zones. 
          It's also high in iron, fiber, and vitamins A and C. There are many species of amaranth/callaloo, 
          some of which flower, and in many cases, virtually all parts of the healthy plant case be used. 
          I've even read that the grains can be good feed for farm animals.

          <h5>Ways I'd Improve My Procedure</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Simply becoming more experienced with and privy to all parts of developing a hydroponic system should help.          
            </li>
            <li>I’d try to be slightly less subject to my own criticism and put a design out when it was due. I might have had much more time to refine it and realize everything else I wanted to if I did. It was one of the most foundational projects. 
            </li>
            <li>Brainstorm one hydroponic system of several different types before the project begins, then simply adjust the one that's best for my project to site and crop specifications. It was difficult for me to focus on design as much as I wanted and truly exercise my creativity since I wanted to give all the other assignments proper time and not fall behind schedule again.
            </li>
            <li>I did plenty of research, as is my nature, but should have sorted it all immediately from the start. 
            </li>
            <li>Revel in the fact that most assignments in our course were living documents / "works in progress."  
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <!-- Advice for one hoping to do the same -->
        <h5>Those with a similar task, know the following...</h5>  
        <p class="sbjctmatter">
          - You need solid procedures and failure contingencies in mind throughout the process, especially once your system is live. If you’re an absolute neophyte to working with hydroponics as I am, I’d suggest you either begin with a simple crop or a simple system design, then build to more demanding ones once you’re competent.
          <br><br>
          Openly question available experts and instructors, yet also gain comfort doing your own research. E-mails and phone calls to local organizations can also be fruitful. If you’re actually going to build and tend the system yourself, be warned—it’ll constantly demand some of your time. Problems ignored and left to fester could kill your plants. 
          <br><br>
          Trace your understanding! That is, assure that you know how you executed the parts of your project. That's one of the surest facets of learning, and may even grant you the capacity to better reproduce your experience.
          <br><br>
          This project isn't over just because you submitted it, even after the presentation, and even if you don't intend to build it. You can still apply refinements.
